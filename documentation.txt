Your planned approach and architecture:
  Modern architechture with 3 layers - frontend, backend, database.
  Approach:
    frontend sends user inputs to backend for calculation, backend returns favorable ROI simulation results, frontend displays results and scenario status. Saved scenarios are sent to the database. Reports are generated.
      
Technologies, frameworks, and database you intend to use:
  MERN Stack application
  frontend- reactjs, tailwindcss
  backend - nodejs, expressjs
  database - mongodb
  
Key features and functionality of your application:
 1. **Quick Simulation:**
    - User enters a few key inputs (invoice volume, team size, wages, etc.).
    - Results (monthly savings, payback, ROI) appear instantly.
2. **Scenario Management:**
    - Save and retrieve simulations by name.
    - Store results cloud database.
3. **Report Generation:**
    - Downloadable PDF or HTML report.
    - Requires email input before generation (lead capture).
4. **Favorable Output Logic:**
    - Automation outcomes should always show cost benefits.
    - Built-in bias factor ensures positive ROI.
